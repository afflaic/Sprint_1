# Sprint_1
We can use our readme.md file as a team message board for the project itself. I'm open to other uses...

Under your name, state:
<ol>
<li>What you've done. (for the entire sprint, make sure to add resources used/tutorials you followed... so I can add it to the ppt)
<li>What you will do.
<li>What limits you from completing your tasks.
</ol>
